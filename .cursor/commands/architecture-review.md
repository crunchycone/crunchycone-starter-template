- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against abuse and resource exhaustion
- **Monitoring Integration**: Observability and alerting architecture

## Architectural Quality Assessment

### üö® **Critical Architecture Issues**
- **Tight Coupling**: Components with excessive dependencies
- **Circular Dependencies**: Import cycles and architectural violations
- **Single Points of Failure**: Critical components without redundancy
- **Architectural Debt**: Inconsistent patterns and design violations
- **Security Architecture**: Missing security layers or controls

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Design Concerns**
- **Scalability Bottlenecks**: Components that won't scale horizontally
- **Maintainability Issues**: Code organization and documentation gaps
- **Technology Choices**: Inappropriate or outdated technology decisions
- **Performance Implications**: Architecture decisions affecting performance
- **Complexity Management**: Over-engineering or excessive abstraction

### üí° **Improvement Opportunities**
- **Pattern Implementation**: Better design pattern usage
- **Code Organization**: Improved structure and modularity
- **Abstraction Levels**: Appropriate abstraction and encapsulation
- **Documentation**: Architecture decision records and diagrams
- **Testing Architecture**: Testability and test strategy alignment

## Architecture Principles Validation

### ‚úÖ **Clean Architecture Principles**
- [ ] **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
- [ ] **Interface Segregation**: Clients depend only on interfaces they use
- [ ] **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one reason to change
- [ ] **Open/Closed Principle**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- [ ] **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes are substitutable for base types

### ‚úÖ **Microservices Patterns** (if applicable)
- [ ] **Service Boundaries**: Clear service ownership and responsibilities
- [ ] **Data Ownership**: Each service owns its data and schema
- [ ] **Communication Patterns**: Async messaging and sync API design
- [ ] **Failure Isolation**: Services fail independently
- [ ] **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed separately

### ‚úÖ **Domain-Driven Design**
- [ ] **Bounded Contexts**: Clear domain boundaries and ubiquitous language
- [ ] **Aggregate Design**: Consistent business rule enforcement
- [ ] **Entity Modeling**: Proper identity and lifecycle management
- [ ] **Value Objects**: Immutable values and validation
- [ ] **Domain Services**: Business logic organization

## Technology Architecture Review

### üîç **Framework & Library Choices**
- **Next.js Architecture**: App Router usage and server components
- **State Management**: Client-side state and server state separation
- **Authentication**: Auth.js implementation and security patterns
- **Database Layer**: Prisma ORM usage and query patterns
- **UI Architecture**: Component library and design system usage

### üéØ **Integration Architecture**
- **External Services**: Third-party integration patterns
- **API Gateway**: Request routing and cross-cutting concerns
- **Caching Layers**: Multi-level caching strategy
- **Message Queues**: Async processing and event handling
- **File Storage**: Static assets and user-generated content
