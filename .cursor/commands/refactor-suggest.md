## Refactoring Recommendations Format

### üéØ **High-Impact Refactoring** (Maximum benefit)
Quick wins that significantly improve code quality with minimal risk:
- **Extract Method**: Break down large functions
- **Rename Variables**: Improve code readability
- **Remove Duplication**: Consolidate repeated code
- **Simplify Conditionals**: Reduce complex if/else chains
- **Extract Constants**: Remove magic numbers and strings

### üîÑ **Medium-Impact Refactoring** (Moderate effort, good returns)
Improvements that require more effort but provide substantial benefits:
- **Introduce Interfaces**: Better abstraction and testability
- **Replace Conditional with Polymorphism**: Cleaner object-oriented design
- **Move Method/Field**: Better class organization
- **Extract Class**: Split large classes into focused units
- **Introduce Parameter Object**: Simplify method signatures

### üèóÔ∏è **Strategic Refactoring** (Long-term improvements)
Larger refactoring efforts that improve architecture and maintainability:
- **Introduce Design Patterns**: Better structural organization
- **Replace Inheritance with Composition**: More flexible design
- **Introduce Service Layer**: Better separation of concerns
- **Extract Module**: Better code organization
- **Introduce Event System**: Decoupled communication

## Refactoring Safety Guidelines

### ‚úÖ **Safe Refactoring Practices**
- **Incremental Changes**: Small, reversible modifications
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure tests exist before refactoring
- **Version Control**: Commit frequently during refactoring
- **Automated Testing**: Run tests after each change
- **Code Review**: Get feedback on refactoring changes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Refactoring Risks**
- **Breaking Changes**: API modifications affecting other code
- **Performance Impact**: Ensuring optimizations don't hurt performance
- **Behavioral Changes**: Maintaining exact functional behavior
- **Integration Issues**: Impact on external dependencies
- **Team Communication**: Coordinating large refactoring efforts

## Code Smell Detection

### üö® **Critical Code Smells** (Immediate attention)
- **Long Methods**: Functions over 20-30 lines
- **Large Classes**: Classes with too many responsibilities
- **Duplicate Code**: Identical or very similar code blocks
- **Long Parameter Lists**: Methods with too many parameters
- **God Objects**: Classes that know/do too much

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Design Smells** (Architecture concerns)
- **Feature Envy**: Classes using methods from other classes excessively
- **Inappropriate Intimacy**: Classes knowing too much about each other
- **Refused Bequest**: Subclasses not using inherited methods
- **Shotgun Surgery**: Changes requiring modifications in many places
- **Divergent Change**: One class changing for multiple reasons

### üí° **Minor Smells** (Quality improvements)
- **Dead Code**: Unused methods, variables, or imports
- **Speculative Generality**: Over-engineering for future needs
- **Primitive Obsession**: Overuse of primitive types
- **Data Clumps**: Related data that should be grouped
- **Comments**: Excessive comments explaining bad code

## Technology-Specific Refactoring

### ‚öõÔ∏è **React/Frontend Refactoring**
- **Component Decomposition**: Breaking large components into smaller ones
- **Hook Extraction**: Custom hooks for reusable logic
- **State Management**: Better state organization and context usage
- **Performance Optimization**: Memoization and render optimization
- **Accessibility Improvement**: Better semantic HTML and ARIA usage

### üîß **Node.js/Backend Refactoring**
- **Middleware Organization**: Better Express middleware structure
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling patterns
- **Database Layer**: Repository pattern and query optimization
- **API Structure**: RESTful design and endpoint organization
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-based configuration

### üóÑÔ∏è **Database Refactoring**
- **Query Optimization**: More efficient database queries
- **Schema Normalization**: Better table structure and relationships
- **Index Optimization**: Proper indexing for query performance
- **Migration Safety**: Safe schema change procedures
- **Data Access Patterns**: Better ORM usage and query patterns

## Refactoring Action Plan

### üìã **Refactoring Checklist**
For each suggested refactoring:
