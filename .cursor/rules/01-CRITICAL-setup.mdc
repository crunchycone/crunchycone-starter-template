# 🚀 Project Setup Guide

## Welcome! Let's get your project up and running.

This guide will help you set up your development environment step by step.

## 📦 Setup Steps (Please follow in order)

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
#### When `node_modules` doesn't exist:
- **What to do**: Let's install the project dependencies
- **Run**: `npm install`
- **What this does**: Downloads all the packages your project needs
- **Success message**: "✅ Dependencies installed successfully!"

**Why this is important**:
- Provides all the tools and libraries your app needs
- Required before any other setup steps can work

#### Additional check - When `package-lock.json` doesn't exist but `node_modules` exists:
- **What to do**: Regenerate the lock file for consistency
- **Run**: `npm install`
- **Success message**: "✅ Lock file created"

### Step 2: Configure Environment
#### When `.env` file doesn't exist:
- **What to do**: Set up your environment configuration
- **Run**: `npm run setup-env`
- **What this does**: Creates .env file and generates a secure JWT secret automatically
- **Success message**: "✅ Environment configured with secure JWT secret!"

**Why this is important**:
- Database setup needs environment variables
- JWT secret is required for authentication

### Step 3: Setup Database
#### When `prisma/db/prod.db` doesn't exist:
- **What to do**: Let's create your database
- **Run**: `npm run db:reset --yes`
- **What this does**: Creates a fresh database with initial data
- **Success message**: "✅ Database ready! Default roles created."

**Why this is important**:
- Your app needs a database to store information
- Includes default user and admin roles

### Step 4: Generate Prisma Client
#### When `node_modules/.prisma/client/index.js` doesn't exist:
- **What to do**: Generate the database client
- **Run**: `npx prisma generate`
- **What this does**: Creates TypeScript types for your database
- **Success message**: "✅ Prisma client ready!"

## 🎉 All Done! Time to Start Developing

Once all setup steps are complete:
```bash
npm run dev:open
```

This will automatically open your browser at:
- 🌐 **http://localhost:3000**

You should see the welcome page, and you can:
- Set up your admin account (first time only)
- Sign in and explore the features
- Start building your application!

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Guide

### If You See These Errors:

**"command not found" or "Cannot find module"**
- **Solution**: Run `npm install` first
- This means dependencies aren't installed yet

**"JWT_SECRET is not defined"**
- **Solution**: Run `npm run setup-env`
- This sets up your environment file with secure JWT secret

**"Database file not found"**
- **Solution**: Run `npm run db:reset --yes`
- This creates your database

**"Cannot find module '.prisma/client'"**
- **Solution**: Run `npx prisma generate`
- This generates the Prisma client

## 📋 Complete Setup Checklist

Here's everything in one place:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (do this first!)
npm install

# 2. Configure environment (do this second!)
npm run setup-env

# 3. Setup database (do this third!)
npm run db:reset --yes

# 4. Start developing! 🚀 (Opens browser automatically)
npm run dev:open
```

The browser will open automatically at **http://localhost:3000** and you're ready to go!

## 💡 Helpful Tips

### Working with Schema Changes
When you modify `prisma/schema.prisma`:
```bash
# Use migrate to update database AND generate types
npx prisma migrate dev --name "your-change-description"
```

### Need a Fresh Start?
```bash
# Complete reset (removes all data)
rm -rf node_modules prisma/db/prod.db .env
npm install
npm run setup-env
npm run db:reset --yes
npm run dev:open  # You're back with browser!
```

### Quick Database Reset
```bash
# Reset database only (keeps dependencies)
npm run db:reset --yes
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

After running `npm run dev:open` (browser opens automatically):
1. Browser automatically opens to http://localhost:3000
2. Set up your admin account (first time)
3. Explore the admin dashboard
4. Start building your features!

📌 **Pro tip**: Keep `npm run dev` running while you work - it auto-refreshes when you make changes!
