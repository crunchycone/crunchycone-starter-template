# Project Setup Rules

This file contains automated setup rules for the production starter template project.

## Setup Dependencies

When `package-lock.json` doesn't exist:
- Show message: "It looks like this is a new project and dependencies are not installed."
- Run command: `npm install`

## Setup Environment

When `.env` file doesn't exist:
- Show message: "Environment variables are not configured. Creating .env file from template."
- Run command: `cp .env.example .env`
- Show reminder: "Please update the JWT_SECRET in your .env file for security."

## Setup Database

When `db/prod.db` doesn't exist:
- Show message: "Database file does not exist. Setting up database with migrations and seed data..."
- Run command: `npm run db:reset --yes`
- Show message: "Database setup complete! Default roles (user, admin) have been created."

## Verify Setup

When all of the following exist:
- `package-lock.json`
- `.env`
- `node_modules/.prisma/client/index.js`
- `db/prod.db`

Show message: "âœ… Project setup is complete! You can now run 'npm run dev' to start the development server."

## Notes

These setup rules run automatically to ensure the project is properly configured for development. The setup process includes:
1. Installing npm dependencies
2. Creating environment configuration from template
3. Setting up the SQLite database with migrations and seed data
4. Verifying all components are properly installed

The `npm run db:reset` command handles:
- Creating the database directory
- Running Prisma migrations
- Generating the Prisma client
- Seeding initial data (user and admin roles)
