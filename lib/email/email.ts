/**
 * @deprecated This file is deprecated and kept only for reference.
 * All email functionality has been migrated to the new system in:
 * - lib/email/auth-email-wrapper.ts (for auth-related emails)
 * - crunchycone-lib (for email service providers and templating)
 *
 * The old ConsoleEmailProvider and email template functions have been removed.
 * Please use the new system instead:
 * - sendPasswordResetEmail() from @/lib/email/auth-email-wrapper
 * - sendAdminPasswordResetEmail() from @/lib/email/auth-email-wrapper
 * - sendMagicLinkEmail() from @/lib/email/auth-email-wrapper
 * - sendVerificationEmail() from @/lib/email/auth-email-wrapper
 * - sendWelcomeEmail() from @/lib/email/auth-email-wrapper
